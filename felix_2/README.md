# Set-switch paradigm

This paradigm is used in a running study, and published as an example of how a
paradigm using [PyParadigm](https://github.com/KnorrFG/pyparadigm) can look. The
main-file is paradigm.py

It has the following requirements:

* pyparadigm
* toolz

both are installable via pip.

The file *paradigm.py* contains the main logic, *resources.py* contains the code
to load the stimuli, *render.py* contains all PyParadigm code to generate the
displayed screens, and *config.py* contains all variables that might need adjustment.
